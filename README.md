Strava Challenge Fetcher
===
Let's face it. We all like the shiny virtual badges on Strava. But for some reason, Strava is insistent upon hiding some
challenges in some regions, and only letting us find out about them through the grapevine. So I decided to make a simple
but nifty tool to fetch all recent Strava challenges to make sure I'm not missing any.

I've actually been using this thing for a while, and I'm currently redoing it as a publicly accessible webpage, so that
all the challenges can finally be out in the open somewhere, but I figured it would be nice to put my Python script up
just in case it comes in handy for someone.
